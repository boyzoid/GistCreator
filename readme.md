GistCreator is a ColdFusion Builder extension for creating Gists. It requires you to have an existing
Github username and password. It works with ColdFusion Builder 2 and ColdFusion 10, but the ColdFusion 10
requirement is only within the "settings" keyword in Application.cfc. That could be removed in seconds.


## Updates

Based on a suggest by Andy Matthews, the extension now returns the embed url in a nice little box you can quickly cut and paste.
